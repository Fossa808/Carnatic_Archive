                <h4>Nada: </h4>
                <p>A musical sound.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Sruthi: </h4>
                <p>The smallest perceptible interval of pitch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Svara: </h4>
                <p>A musical note or pitch. The seven fundamental
                    notes are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni. They are the short forms
                    of Shadjam, Rishabham, Gandharam, Madhyamam, Panchamam, Dhaivatam,
                    and Nishadam, respectively. </p>

            <li>
                <h4>Sthayi: </h4>
                <p>Sthayi refers to an octave or a span of seven notes (svaras).</p>

            <li>
                <h4>Ragas:</h4>
                <p>A Raga is a melodic framework that provides a foundation for
                    composition. It has specific rules for ascending and descending
                    scales and characteristic musical motifs.</p>
                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                        <h5><ins>Janaka Ragas (Melakarta Ragas):</ins></h5>
                        <p>They are the 72 fundamental or "parent" scales. They are
                            characterized by having all seven notes (Svaras) in both
                            the ascending (Arohanam) and descending (Avarohanam) scales.
                            Each Janaka raga has a unique pattern of notes, and they are
                            the basis for all other ragas in the system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5><ins>Janya Ragas (Melajanyam Ragas):</ins></h5>
                        <p>These are ragas derived from Janaka ragas by varying or omitting
                            notes from the parent scale. Janya ragas often have fewer than
                            seven notes in their ascending or descending scales. They can be
                            classified based on the number of notes they contain (e.g. Auḍava
                            ragas have five notes, Shadava ragas have six notes, Sampoorna ragas
                            have all seven notes). </p>

                <h4>Talas: </h4>
                <p>Tala is a rhythmic structure in Carnatic music that is made up of a
                    repeating cycle of beats. It is a fundamental part of Carnatic music
                    as it provides a blueprint for musicians to follow as they perform a
                    composition. </p>

                        <p>The seven fundamental talas that form the basis for rhythmic
                            structure and improvisation in music. They are Dhruva (14 beats),
                            Matya (10 beats), Rupakam (6 beats), Eka (4 beats), Jhampa
                            (7 beats), Triputa (8 beats), and Ata (12 beats).</p>

                            which are Anudrutam, Drutam, Laghu, Guru, Plutam, and Kakapadam</p>

                        <h5><ins>Chapu Talas: </ins></h5>
                        <p>The rhythmic cycles that fall outside the standard "Suladi Sapta Tala"
                            system, representing syncopated time measures where the beat falls
                            on an unaccented place, with variations like Misra Chapu (7 beats)
                            (Thakita Thaka Dhimi), Khanda Chapu (5 beats), Tisra Chapu (3 beats),
                            and Sankeerna Chapu (9 beats). This Tala has evolved from South Indian
                            folk music and even the name has Tamil roots from the word Chaippu,
                            meaning slanting or sloping. The two parts (angas) has increasing counts
                            such 2+3, 3+4 or 4+5.</p>
